Mobility felt great. Slowed t down a bit more than the videos version. Third rep barely made it through with good form. Got through all five reps which surprised me. Arms did shake a bit but not enough to discount to bad form. Well try level two next. During the cat stretches I am already noticing some tightness in my lower back.</p><p>Straddle Planch destroyed me. I've never done an exercise like it noticing pain in my wrists immediately lots of tension in my arms and really hitting my upper back. Keeping it at 1 set today and will start level 1 day one next workout day. I lied, after re-watching the video and completing the mobility exercise I felt good enough to try a second set but not as deep as I was going the first time. Still destroying my upper back and noticed issues in my wrist but it went much better. Hip swivels are amazing by the way and my hips and knees are loving them. Left shoulder injury started acting up on the fourth set so I decided to stop here plenty of exercise left for the day</p><p>Supermans I only got to 30 seconds into the first rep. Going to be some progression there. Hip rotations felt good but were small circles. Will improve with time </p><p>Manannas were fairly easy for me as I have been doing a lot of tucks here recently. But the shoulder mobility blew me away. Reminds me a lot of a snatch or Turkish get up. Something I haven't done in a while and the range of motion feels good after the first set. No discomfort yet. Familiar popping in my right shoulder after the second set. Also forgot to mention my Manana is not smooth but an involuntary jerking motion is occurring almost like my body is sputtering. Form started slipping on fourth set and decided to call it here.</p><p>Roll up squats I did fairly well on. A few of the reps were not clean so Im not going to do a second set. It was tricky to get the form down and I feel like my left leg was trying to compensate for my right knee problem but I didn't feel any discomfort. Knee mobility felt great even though I stopped only 1 set of the exercise I'm going to try and continue with the mobility section. Third set of mobility and right knee is starting to show some signs of discomfort. Calling it here, one thing to note is it is actually extremely difficult to kick my hips out in the opposite direction of my knees and I can feel it working my ankle flexibility as well all of which is lacking so it is great.</p><p>Gym started getting busy so I drove home for the incline push ups. Decided to use my kitchen counter since I am 6'2'' and it's hip height for me. Knocked all the push ups out easily but I did just got off of a regiment I was trying out where I would do extremely slow (8-10 seconds down and 8-10 seconds up) bench press and dips so my chest was ready for the load. I am having problems with my left rotator cuff now, it started flaring up about half way through the second set but wasn't enough to stop me. The German twists were easy for a change though still caused my left shoulder pain when it was its turn for my left arm to go behind my head. </p><picture>

 <p>Have to wait for my roomate to wake up to get the pull up bar from his room for the last exercise and decided to cook some dinner in the mean time. Lemon butter tilapia, homeade zucchini stefano knock off and some buttered broccoli. Keto friendly goodness.</p><picture>

 <p>Finally able to appropriate the pull up bar and since i dont have rings we went hood style and used a system of interloping belts to support my weight at the right height from the ground for the last exercise. Was only able to complete two sets but I'm not sure if it was because i was already so cooled off or if my ghetto setup made it more difficult or if I am just a pussy.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="26"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="28"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="29"><span data-reactid="30"><!-- react-empty: 31 --><h2 data-reactid="32"><a data-reactid="33">HiTimTurner</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="36"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="37"></div></section></div></div>

Form started slipping on fourth set and decided to call it here."},{"id":"2877b513-e94c-4b2b-ba17-25010a2428d2","item":"2f88dbcd-7596-4e86-b85e-c84b4d4975ab","type":"text","html":"<p>Roll up squats I did fairly well on.
